\paragraph{Daniel Antunes}
Daniel Antunes received his B.S. in computer science from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2014) and his M.S. in  computer science from Universit\'e Paris-Est, France (2016). Since February 2017 he is a Ph.D student in the laboratory of mathematics (LAMA) at Universit\'e Savoie Mont Blanc, France. His research interests is focused on digital geometry and combinatorial optimization applied to image analysis.


\paragraph{Jacques-Olivier Lachaud}
Jacques-Olivier Lachaud graduated from ENSIMAG engineering school in
Computer Science in 1994 and received a Ph.D. degree in computer
science from Joseph Fourier University (Grenoble, France) in 1998 and
the Habilitation from University Bordeaux 1 in 2006. He is now a
Professor of Computer Science at the University Savoie Mont Blanc
(Chamb√©ry, France) and works in the laboratory of mathematics
(LAMA). His research interests are in image analysis and geometry
processing, more specifically deformable models, energy-minimizing
techniques, digital geometry and topology. He has written over 100
articles in international journals and conferences on these topics.
%% JO :-D A splendid researcher, great mentor and fast friend.
